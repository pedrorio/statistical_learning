    abstract = "We propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests at the certification step. A large dataset (when compared to other studies in this domain) is considered, with white and red vinho verde samples (from Portugal). Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming the multiple regression and neural network methods. Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. Furthermore, similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets."

    abstract = "We introduce a new method for robust principal component analysis (PCA). Classical PCA is based on the empirical covariance matrix of the data and hence is highly sensitive to outlying observations. Two robust approaches have been developed to date. The first approach is based on the eigenvectors of a robust scatter matrix such as the minimum covariance determinant or an S-estimator and is limited to relatively low-dimensional data. The second approach is based on projection pursuit and can handle high-dimensional data. Here we propose the ROBPCA approach, which combines projection pursuit ideas with robust scatter matrix estimation. ROBPCA yields more accurate estimates at noncontaminated datasets and more robust estimates at contaminated data. ROBPCA can be computed rapidly, and is able to detect exact-fit situations. As a by-product, ROBPCA produces a diagnostic plot that displays and classifies the outliers. We apply the algorithm to several datasets from chemometrics and engineering."
